#Calculator Project

##Goals
To create a working calculator using Javascript and HTML, and stylising using CSS.

Evaluates a pair of numbers at a time.
User is able to create a long string of operations.
Returns error message when user divides by 0, or begins input with an operator.
Disables appropriate buttons such that invalid input cannot occur.

A friend suggested that I stylise the calculator with a Tamagotchi theme, which was a blast to implement and made me feel much more proud.

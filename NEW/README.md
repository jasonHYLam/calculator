## Goals
To create a working calculator using Javascript and HTML, and stylising using CSS.

  - Evaluates a pair of numbers at a time.
  - User is able to create a long string of operations.
  - Returns error message when user divides by 0, or begins input with an operator.
  - Disables appropriate buttons such that invalid input cannot occur.

A friend suggested that I stylise the calculator with a Tamagotchi theme, which was really fun to implement.
